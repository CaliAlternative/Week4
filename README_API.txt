-I will be connecting to DATA USA (https://datausa.io/about/api/) and a attempt find how many Thai speakers per state


-the function ApiConnection accepts a website url as a parameter and tries to connect

-The trying to manipulate the data is very difficult with unformatted data

- I must find a way to iterate through data but it requires some extra care to how im reading data

-The last line of code few lines of code are completely independednt of the previous line but the last 5 lines 
reads in json data directly to JSON
